## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install agentic-utils/tap/ccs
```

### From source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.21+.

```bash
go install github.com/agentic-utils/ccs@latest
```

### Manual

Download the binary from [releases](https://github.com/agentic-utils/ccs/releases) and add to your PATH.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) - must be installed and used at least once

## Usage

```bash
# Search recent conversations (last 60 days, files <1GB)
ccs

# Search with initial query
ccs buyer

# Search last 7 days only
ccs --max-age=7

# Search everything (all time, all files)
ccs --all

# Resume with plan mode
ccs -- --plan

# Combined: search "buyer", resume with plan mode
ccs buyer -- --plan
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-age=N` | 60 | Only search files modified in the last N days (0 = no limit) |
| `--max-size=N` | 1024 | Max file size in MB to include (0 = no limit) |
| `--all` | - | Include everything (same as `--max-age=0 --max-size=0`) |

### Keybindings

- `↑/↓` or `Ctrl+P/N` - Navigate list
- `Enter` - Resume selected conversation
- `Ctrl+D` - Delete selected conversation (with confirmation)
- `Ctrl+J/K` - Scroll preview
- `Mouse wheel` - Scroll list or preview (context-aware)
- `Ctrl+U` - Clear search
- `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` - Quit

## How it works

ccs reads conversation history from `~/.claude/projects/` and presents them in an interactive TUI. When you select a conversation, it changes to the original project directory and runs `claude --resume <session-id>`.
